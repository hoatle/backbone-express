A template project using Backbone and Express.  We are trying to make a barebones backbone SPA with express API.

We are using:
- dotenv for env variables
- mongoose with mongodb
- passport for local, facebook and google auth
- gulp to build
- browserify for modules on frontend
- no BOWER.  we're using npm for everything
